## ContraDoc: Understanding Self-Contradictions in Documents with Large Language Models

This is the repo for [ContraDoc: Understanding Self-Contradictions in Documents with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09182).

### Dataset Introduction:

CONTRADOC contains 449 self-contradictory(positive examples) and 442 non-contradictory(negative examples) documents, covering documents sourced from CNN_Dailymain News, Wikipedia and Story Summaries, document length varying from 300 to 2200 tokens. This dataset is created by introducing self-contradiction to documents using GPT-4-Modify => Human Annotate and Verify. This dataset is developed as a benchmark to test model's ability in finding contradiction in long document.

### Dataset Format:

The positive examples are in "pos", while negative examples are in "neg", please refer to the paper for more detials of each label.

``````json

  {"DOC_ID":

      "evidence": SENTENCE_INTRODUCING_CONTRADICTION,
      "unique id": DOC_ID,

      "doc_type": "story_OR_news_OR_wiki",
      "unique id": DOC_ID
    },
  },
}

### Dataset Creation:

One needs to firstly generate and store false documents generated by GPT
Remember to setup your openai api key
```
cd extract
mkdir contradiction_json
extract.py # check --help for information/options
```
The raw files will be stored in `contradiction_json`, then aggregate the files, and run `contradoc_create.py` to do insertion, replacement, and initial filter for generated false document candidates. 
*Note that all generated documents need further verification by humans to guarantee the validity.*
